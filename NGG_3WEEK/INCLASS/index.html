              Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods
              include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators,
              however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative
              effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

              Quality of Working Life (QWL) describes a person's broader employment-related experience. Various authors
              and researchers have proposed models of quality of working life – also referred to as quality of worklife –
              which include a wide range of factors, sometimes classified as "motivator factors" which if present can make
              the job experience a positive one, and "hygiene factors" which if lacking are more associated with dissatisfaction.
              A number of rating scales have been developed aiming to measure overall quality of working life or certain aspects thereof.
              Some publications have drawn attention to the importance of QWL for both employees and employers, and also for national economic performance.

            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family">
              In human society, family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth) or
              affinity (by marriage or other relationship). The purpose of families is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society.
              Ideally, families would offer predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and participate in the community.[1] In most
              societies, it is within families that children acquire socialization for life outside the family. Additionally, as the basic unit for
              meeting the basic needs of its members, it provides a sense of boundaries for performing tasks in a safe environment, ideally builds a
              person into a functional adult, transmits culture, and ensures continuity of humankind with precedents of knowledge.
